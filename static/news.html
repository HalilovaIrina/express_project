        <p class="text">
          “Negro History Week” was founded by Carter G. Woodson, a black historian
          and public school teacher,<br />
          in February 1926, when little (if any) black history was acknowledged in
          schools. Says Givens, Woodson<br />
          saw the week as an opportunity to bring about “an epistemic shift in
          schools” — for teachers to<br />
          illuminate the way racial power operated in America, and for students to
          reimagine the way<br />
          knowledge and history were constructed.<br />
    
          Soon, more than 80 percent of black schools were actively celebrating
          the week, using it as a<br />
          springboard to refocus their communities on black history and
          accomplishments, and to appeal to<br />
          school boards to change curriculum, buy new books, and rethink
          programming. In 1976, the campaign<br />
          was expanded and renamed Black History Month.
